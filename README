I included a folder named appcompat_v7. If your android project could not find R, import appcompat_v7 as an android project and include the project under IsLibrary in Configure Build Path.

How to start Web Server:
you need to have python3 then install the following package
  - flask (pip3 install Flask)
  - cors extension of flask (pip3 install -U flask-cors)
then run the following command (assume that you are in root directory)
  - cd Web/
  - ./main
Finally, enjoy :D

I included a folder named appcompat_v7. If your android project could not find R, import appcompat_v7 as an android project and include the project under IsLibrary in Configure Build Path.

How to start Web Server:
you need to have python3 then install the following package
  - flask (pip3 install Flask)
  - cors extension of flask (pip3 install -U flask-cors)
then run the following command (assume that you are in root directory)
  - cd Web/
  - ./main

How to start the API Server:
  
To start the API server, simply import the MongoDBWebApp to eclipse as a Maven Project and run the app on a Tomcat Server (v6). This should generate a war file inside the Tomcat server folder.
Once this is done, to start the server each time without eclipse, simply navigate to <Tomcat_Server_Folder>/bin/ and then run "sudo sh startup.sh" in terminal to start the server from terminal.
This will start the server using the war file compiled in eclipse.

Finally, enjoy :D
